Hereâ€™s a complete and professional README.md content for your Movie Recommendation System project on GitHub:

ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built with Python and Streamlit for an interactive UI. It recommends movies to users based on content-based filtering (using cast, crew, genres, and keywords) and/or collaborative filtering (based on user similarity).

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Recommend similar movies based on your preferences

ðŸŽ­ Uses movie metadata like cast, crew, genres, and overviews

ðŸ‘¥ Optionally leverages collaborative filtering using user behavior

ðŸ’¡ Clean and minimal Streamlit UI

ðŸ“Š Backend powered by pandas, scikit-learn, and optional surprise/lightfm for collaborative filtering

ðŸ§  How It Works
ðŸ“š Content-Based Filtering:
Computes TF-IDF vectors from movie descriptions, genres, and keywords

Uses cosine similarity to find and rank similar movies

ðŸ‘¥ Collaborative Filtering (Optional):
Uses user ratings matrix to recommend what similar users liked

Can be added using surprise or LightFM library
