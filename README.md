# Movie-Reccomandation-System
Develop a recommendation algorithm. This could be a content-based system that recommends movies similar to what a user has liked before and based on cast, crews and themes, or a collaborative filtering system that suggests movies liked by similar users.  Use Streamlit to create a user interface for your recommendation system.
