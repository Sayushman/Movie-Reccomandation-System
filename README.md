 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

  A smart and interactive movie recommendation system built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, capable of suggesting movies using **content-based filtering** and optional **collaborative filtering** techniques.

 📌 Features

  ✅ Recommends movies similar to the one you like  
  🎭 Utilizes metadata such as **cast, crew, genres, keywords**, and **overviews**  
  👥 Optionally uses **collaborative filtering** based on user ratings  
  💡 Clean and minimal **Streamlit** UI for ease of use  
  📊 Backend powered by `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and optionally `surprise` or `lightfm` for collaborative filtering

 🧠 How It Works

 📚 Content-Based Filtering
 
  - Extracts TF-IDF vectors from movie descriptions, genres, and keywords
  - Computes **cosine similarity** to rank and recommend similar movies

 👥 Collaborative Filtering (Optional)
 
  - Analyzes a user-item matrix of ratings
  - Suggests movies liked by **similar users**
  - Can be powered by libraries like `surprise` or `lightfm`
