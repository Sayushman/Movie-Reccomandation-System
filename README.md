 🧠 How It Works

 📚 Content-Based Filtering
 
  - Extracts TF-IDF vectors from movie descriptions, genres, and keywords
  - Computes **cosine similarity** to rank and recommend similar movies

 👥 Collaborative Filtering (Optional)
 
  - Analyzes a user-item matrix of ratings
  - Suggests movies liked by **similar users**
  - Can be powered by libraries like `surprise` or `lightfm`
